# Olympic Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Olympic data using Python. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze various aspects of Olympic history, including athlete participation, medal distributions, and trends over time.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis includes information on Olympic athletes, events, medal counts, and demographic details such as age, height, and weight.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization

## Key Steps in the Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
2. **Outlier Detection**: Identifying and handling anomalies in the dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizing the dataset to understand trends and distributions.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to explore relationships between various Olympic metrics.
